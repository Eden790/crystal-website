by ZZZ contributors. We thank all the contributors for all the effort put into
improving the language! ❤️

## Changes

Below we list the most remarkable changes in the language, compiler and stdlib.
For more details, visit the [full changelog](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/releases/tag/1.13.0).

### OpenSSL Default Configuration

The `OpenSSL` bindings previously included some explicit overrides for the default settings of the SSL library. This can be useful to improve the security level when working with older library versions. But it has the opposite effect with newer library versions and hinders the application of more restrictive default configurations.
We removed overrides for cipher suites ([#14655](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14655)) and ECDH curve ([#14656](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14656)). The TLS Server compatibility level recommendations from Mozilla are deprecated as well. They didn't even work correctly before ([#14657](https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal/pull/14657)).
`OpenSSL` now uses the default configuration of the SSL library. Explicit overrides in user code are still possible of course.
