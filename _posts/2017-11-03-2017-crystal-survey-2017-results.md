This year, the Crystal team launched the first official [State of Crystal survey](/2017/07/31/launching-the-2017-state-of-crystal-survey.html). We're amazed by the fantastic feedback from the community.

We received ***757 responses***. Thanks a lot to everyone who took the time to respond! We tried our best to read through all of your comments and suggestions.

Without further ado, let's take a look at the results.

## How did you discover Crystal?

<img src="/assets/blog/GUwgT8n.png" alt="19.9% Google or other search engines, 19.4% HackerNews, 15.6% Reddit, 10.9% Twitter" title="19.9% Google or other search engines, 19.4% HackerNews, 15.6% Reddit, 10.9% Twitter" loading="lazy" />

We wanted to learn how you discovered Crystal, and were surprised to find that a lot of you arrived at Crystal through search engines. On the other hand, we confirmed how important HackerNews and Reddit are to divulge young and small projects such as Crystal. Every now and then, someone from the community posts something interesting about Crystal, the post makes it to HN and Reddit front pages and in the next few days we notice a wave of new users and contributors on the different community channels.

### Using Crystal

<img src="/assets/blog/GP33qmx.png" alt="%47.2 Yes, I'm using Crystal for hobby projects, 32.1% No, but I'm planning to use Crystal, 10.7% No, I'm not using Crystal, 9.9% Yes, I'm Using Crystal in production" title="%47.2 Yes, I'm using Crystal for hobby projects, 32.1% No, but I'm planning to use Crystal, 10.7% No, I'm not using Crystal, 9.9% Yes, I'm Using Crystal in production" loading="lazy" />

There's a deeper story that we see in these numbers, which is consistent with what we hear in informal discussions about Crystal: the community is eager to start using the language in production, but is waiting for more concrete signals from the project. A considerable part of the community doesn't even mind about that and trusts the ecosystem enough to take the leap.

<img src="/assets/blog/GP35Uvi.png" alt="34.7% Less than a month, 19% More than 12 months, 18.9% 1-3 Months, 15.2% 3-6 Months" title="34.7% Less than a month, 19% More than 12 months, 18.9% 1-3 Months, 15.2% 3-6 Months" loading="lazy" />

Crystal community is growing rapidly. We've got a steady growing user base with a lot of new Crystal developers joining every week.

<img src="/assets/blog/GP38e1h.png" alt="63.1% Less than 1.000, 23% 1000 to 10000 lines, 11.5% Not sure, 2% 10000 to 100000 lines" title="63.1% Less than 1.000, 23% 1000 to 10000 lines, 11.5% Not sure, 2% 10000 to 100000 lines" loading="lazy" />

Most of the current Crystal projects are less than 1000 lines, however there are also 17 projects which are in between 10000 and 100000 lines.

<img src="/assets/blog/GP39tRi.png" alt="46.6% Yes, 32.9% Not sure, 11.9% No, 8.9% Not applicable" title="46.6% Yes, 32.9% Not sure, 11.9% No, 8.9% Not applicable" loading="lazy" />

Crystal is a beauty, we know that a lot of you are excited to use it for your daily work :)

Linux is the main platform Crystal developers choose followed by Mac OS. There's also a notable amount (17.9%) of Crystal developers using Windows.

<img src="/assets/blog/GPbIN3w.png" alt="Linux 91.2%, Mac OS 41.5%, Windows 31.1%, Android 13.1%, iOS 10.9%, 5.3% BSD-variant, 9.4% Javascript, 6% Embeeded" title="Linux 91.2%, Mac OS 41.5%, Windows 31.1%, Android 13.1%, iOS 10.9%, 5.3% BSD-variant, 9.4% Javascript, 6% Embeeded" loading="lazy" />

We see a similar pattern in target platforms. Linux is the most targeted platform. Interestingly we see Android, iOS and Javascript in a noticable ratio.

### Towards 1.0

Crystal developers tend to follow the latest stable release.

<img src="/assets/blog/GPdzxCW.png" alt="No 60.7%, Yes, but it happens rarely 29.8%, Yes, and it happens oftern 9.4%" title="No 60.7%, Yes, but it happens rarely 29.8%, Yes, and it happens oftern 9.4%" loading="lazy" />

We try to keep breaking changes as minimum as possible. More than %60 of Crystal developers don't have any significant changes to their code when upgrading to a new version.

<img src="/assets/blog/GPdDVTd.png" alt="OS Package manager 86.4%, Binary tarballs 7%, Manually 4.7%" title="OS Package manager 86.4%, Binary tarballs 7%, Manually 4.7%" loading="lazy" />

Using OS package managers to install Crystal is the most common and simple way to start. There are also prebuilt binary tarballs for major platforms.

## Closing Thoughts

At the end of the survey, we asked: “Anything else you’d like to tell us?”

I’ll let some of the quotes speak for themselves:

> Keep up the great work!

> I love Crystal, and I want to use it more! Thank you!

> Crystal is my first loved programming language :)

> I can't wait for the 1.0 release! Great job on everything so far.

> I love you guys, keep it up! As a Rubyist with no prior experience with compiled languages, this was definitely and by far the easiest way to learn about them and get used to a strongly typed language.

Thanks to everyone who make Crystal and this survey possible <3

Happy Crystalling!
